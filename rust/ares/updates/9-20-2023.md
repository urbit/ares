## David
- Datastructures for B-tree done
- How is checksumming going to work? (DW for now)
- find is implemented
- working on insert/delete, expect completion today
- next step is to implement memory management on top of the B-tree
- and memory freelists

## Alex
- stack traces awaiting review
- expect ctrl-c handling by EOW

## Jonathan
- Expect fast jets PR ready for review by EOD
- will be tested with fast-hinted baby pill

## Edward
- Codegen was stalled a bit by need to jump-start PMA. Aiming to merge PR by EOW.
- After codegen is bytecode

## Neal
- `jet_peg` probably done, but—
- `jet_peg` tests (`test_peg`) run but fail—this was leading me down the printf rabbithole but I haven't resolved it yet.
- I began mapping the structure of Vere's crypto jets to see what calls what and comparing to Rust. But [Edward] thinks we should map to wrapped C calls instead, so I'll need to look into that.
- The `safe_add` &c. is gone now because Either was still making the code very complicated.
