/* XX
 * ~master-morzod suggests splitting stack frames:
 * when FP-relative slots are on the west stack, allocate on the east stack, and vice versa.
 * This would mean that traversal stacks must be allocated adjacent to the current frame's locals,
 * rather than being allocated adjacent to the previous frame, which may in fact make more sense.
 *
 * This would enable completely reliable tail calls. Currently we cannot do tail-call optimization
 * reliably for indirect calls, since the called arm might need arbitrarily many stack slots. With
 * the proposed "split" layoud we can simply extend the number of slots if a tail-called arm
 * requires more.
 *
 * Unless I'm mistaken this requires a three-pointer stack: the frame pointer is the basis for
 * relative-offset locals as per usual, the stack pointer denotes the extent of the current frame,
 * and the allocation denotes the current frontier of allocations on the opposite stack.
 *
 * Allocation means bumping the allocation pointer as per usual. Traversal stacks are implemented
 * by saving the stack pointer to a local and then manipulating the stack pointer.
 *
 * Pushing is implemented by setting the frame pointer to the allocation pointer, the stack pointer
 * to the necessary offset from the frame pointer to accomodate the locals, and the allocation
 * pointer to the stack pointer. The previous values of all three are saved in the new frame's
 * first three locals.
 *
 * Popping must first save the parent-frame stored values to temporaries. Then a copy is run which
 * will, in general, run over the stored locals, and update the temporary for the allocation
 * pointer. Finally, the temporaries are restored as the current frame/stack/allocation pointer.
 *
 * An alternative to this model is to copy anyway when making a tail call, using the tail call's
 * parameters as roots. (Notably this requires the copier to take a list of mutable references to
 * roots.) This ensures that no allocations are in the way if we need to extend the list of locals,
 * at the expense of removing an obvious point of programmer control over the timing of memory
 * management.

     * There can be references outside the current frame, but since only the current frame will be

     * and are in the current frame, we are done.

     * Since our to-space is the previous frame, we maintain a work stack at the end of the current
     * frame, past the allocations. This is inverse from when we do a noun traversal generally,
     * where we may want to allocate on the current frame, so we maintain a work stack adjacent to

     * equality) and then unifies the nouns at the top level if they are equal.
     *
     * Here we recursively attempt to unify nouns. Pointer-equal nouns are already unified.
     * Disequal mugs again short-circuit the unification and equality check.
     *
     * Since we expect atoms to be normalized, direct and indirect atoms do not unify with each
     * other. For direct atoms, no unification is possible as there is no pointer involved in their
     * representation. Equality is simply direct equality on the word representation. Indirect
     * atoms require equality first of the size and then of the memory buffers' contents.
     *
     * Cell equality is tested (after mug and pointer equality) by attempting to unify the heads and tails,
     * respectively, of cells, and then re-testing. If unification succeeds then the heads and
     * tails will be pointer-wise equal and the cell itself can be unified. A failed unification of
     * the head or the tail will already short-circuit the unification/equality test, so we will
     * not return to re-test the pointer equality.
     *
     * When actually mutating references for unification, we must be careful to respect seniority.
     * A reference to a more junior noun should always be replaced with a reference to a more
     * senior noun, *never vice versa*, to avoid introducing references from more senior frames
     * into more junior frames, which would result in incorrect operation of the copier.
